Creasign â€“ AI Product Visual Generator

Note: The backend of this app is not always live. It runs on a local server exposed via ngrok, which means:
The /generate/ API works only when the developer is running the server.
If the backend is offline, image generation requests will fail or timeout.
This is intentional during the development phase.
